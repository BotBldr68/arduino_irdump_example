# irdebug.h

The irdebug library for the Arduino attempts to provide simple functions to
play with raw infrared signals, like those emitted by remote controls in your
living room.

Please note that this library focuses on raw signals only, if you're looking
for a library with better understanding of many different protocols, you should
take a look at the [Arduino IRremote][1] project.

## Code example

```ino
#include <irdebug.h>

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Point a infrared remote controller to your sensor and test it.");
}

unsigned int signal[128];

void loop(void) {
  bool captured;
  captured = irdebug_capture_signal(signal);

  if (captured) {
    Serial.println("A wild signal appeared!");

    irdebug_print_signal(signal);

    Serial.println("Waiting 5s.");
    delay(5000);

    Serial.println("Replaying captured signal.");
    irdebug_send(signal, 38);

    Serial.println("Done.");
  }

}
```

## How to install

1. Copy the `lib/irdebug/` directory to your Arduino's library path, for
	 example: `sudo cp -r lib/irdebug /usr/share/arduino/libraries/`.
2. Include the `irdebug.h` file into your main Arduino code, for example
	 `#include <irdebug.h>`.
