# irdebug.h

The irdebug library for the Arduino attempts to provide simple functions to
play with raw infrared signals, like those emitted by remote controls in your
living room.

By default, the IR sensor's data (like a TSOP 18xx) is expected to be wired to
the Arduino's pin #2; while an IR led is expected to be attached to the pin #3.

Please note that this library focuses on raw signals only, if you're looking
for a library with better understanding of many different protocols, you should
take a look at the [Arduino IRremote][1] project.

## Code example

Let's suppose we have the following chunk of code that makes use of the
`irdebug.h` library.

```c
#include <irdebug.h>

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Point an infrared remote controller to your sensor and press any button.");
}

unsigned int signal[128];

void loop(void) {
  bool captured;
  captured = irdebug_capture_signal(signal);

  if (captured) {
    Serial.println("A wild signal appeared!");

    irdebug_print_signal(signal);

    Serial.println("Waiting 5s.");
    delay(5000);

    Serial.println("Replaying captured signal.");
    irdebug_send(signal, 38);

    Serial.println("Done.");
  }

}
```

If we press the center button of an Apple Remote controller, we'll see a read
like this in our serial console:

```
Point an infrared remote controller to your sensor and press any button.
A wild signal appeared!
unsigned int signal[] = {
  9140, 4440,
  600, 520,
  616, 1628,
  596, 1628,
  596, 1648,
  600, 496,
  620, 1624,

  616, 1628,
  600, 1624,
  600, 1624,
  620, 1624,
  604, 500,
  616, 540,
  592, 1632,
  596, 1648,
  600, 0};
Waiting 5s.
Replaying captured signal.
Done.
```

## How to install

1. Copy the `lib/irdebug/` directory to your Arduino's library path, for
	 example: `sudo cp -r lib/irdebug /usr/share/arduino/libraries/`.
2. Include the `irdebug.h` file into your main Arduino code, for example
	 `#include <irdebug.h>`.
